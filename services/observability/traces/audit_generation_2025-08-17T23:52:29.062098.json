  "input": "Therapist: Hi <PERSON>, it’s good to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session on <DATE_TIME> at <DATE_TIME>? <PERSON>, Doc. I’ve been feeling a lot better overall. I’ve been using the coping strategies we talked about, and I’ve started doing things I used to enjoy. My mood has definitely improved, and the depressive symptoms aren’t as bad or as frequent. Therapist: That’s great to hear. Do you want to share any specific experiences that helped with your mood? <PERSON>: Yes, I recently went to a family gathering at my brother’s house, 612 Greenbriar Court in <LOCATION>. My sister, <PERSON>, was visiting from out of town. It was wonderful! I felt really connected and engaged with everyone there. It gave me a good sense of support, which helped a lot. My son, <PERSON>, took photos—I'll forward them to you at <EMAIL_ADDRESS>, if that’s okay. Therapist: I’m glad you had that positive experience. Have you noticed any other changes, such as your energy levels or activity? <PERSON>: Yeah, I’ve been more active—walking and jogging regularly with my neighbor, <PERSON>—and I feel more energetic. Therapist: Excellent progress, <LOCATION>. How about your sleep? Any changes there? <PERSON>: That’s still a bit of a problem. Sometimes I have trouble falling asleep, and I wake up earlier than I want to, usually <DATE_TIME> Therapist: Thanks for letting me know. Just to confirm, is your current insurance still BlueCross BlueShield, Plan ID BX-903482? <PERSON>: Yes, that’s right. And if you need to reach me, my cell is 555-0174 and my work email is <EMAIL_ADDRESS>. Therapist: We’ll continue reinforcing your coping strategies and start focusing more on your sleep—looking at triggers and teaching you relaxation and sleep hygiene techniques. <PERSON>: Sounds good. My birthday’s coming up on <DATE_TIME>, so I’m hoping to celebrate feeling better. Therapist: You’re doing really well. Keep up the good work, and we’ll keep working on these areas next time. See you soon! <PERSON>: Thanks, Doc. See you soon!",
