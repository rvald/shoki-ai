How have you been feeling since our last session on <DATE_TIME>? Hi, Doc. I\\u2019ve been feeling a lot better overall. I\\u2019ve been using the coping strategies we talked about, and I\\u2019ve started doing things I used to enjoy. My mood has definitely improved, and the depressive symptoms aren\\u2019t as bad or as frequent. That\\u2019s great to hear. Do you want to share any specific experiences that helped with your mood? Yes, I recently went to a family gathering at my brother's house on <ADDRESS>. My sister <PERSON> was visiting from out of town. It was wonderful! I felt really connected and engaged with everyone there. It gave me a good sense of support, which helped a lot. My son <PERSON> took photos\\u2014I'll forward them to you at <EMAIL_ADDRESS>, if that's okay. I\\u2019m glad you had that positive experience. Have you noticed any other changes, such as your energy levels or activity? Yeah, I\\u2019ve been more active\\u2014walking and jogging regularly with my neighbor <PERSON>\\u2014and I feel more energetic. Excellent progress, <PERSON>. How about your sleep? Any changes there? That\\u2019s still a bit of a problem. Sometimes I have trouble falling asleep, and I wake up earlier than I want to, usually <DATE_TIME> Thanks for letting me know. Just to confirm, is your current insurance still under Blue Cross Plan ID <DATE_TIME>? Yes, that's right. And if you need to reach me, my cell is <PHONE_NUMBER> and my work email is <EMAIL_ADDRESS>. We\\u2019ll continue reinforcing your coping strategies and start focusing more on your sleep\\u2014looking at triggers and teaching you relaxation and sleep hygiene techniques. Sounds good. My birthday's coming up on <DATE_TIME>, so I\\u2019m hoping to celebrate feeling better. You\\u2019re doing really well. Keep up the good work, and we\\u2019ll keep working on these areas next time.
