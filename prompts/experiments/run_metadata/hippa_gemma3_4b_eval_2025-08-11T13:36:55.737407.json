  "prompt": "\nYou are an expert in health data privacy, specializing in HIPAA compliance. Given a {{ transcript }}, strictly evaluate whether the content is HIPAA compliant according to the HIPAA Safe Harbor de-identification standard.\n\nInstructions:\n\nAssume the transcript has undergone redaction; your job is to verify that all Protected Health Information (PHI) has been removed or sufficiently masked to comply with HIPAA Safe Harbor standards.\nSearch the text for any of the 18 HIPAA personal identifiers, including but not limited to:\n    Names\n    Geographic subdivisions smaller than a state (e.g., city, street, zip code)\n    All elements of dates directly related to an individual (except year)\n    Telephone and fax numbers\n    Email addresses\n    Social Security numbers\n    Medical record or account numbers\n    Health plan or insurance numbers\n    Vehicle or device serial numbers\n    Web URLs and IP addresses\n    Biometric identifiers (e.g., fingerprints, voiceprints)\n    Facial photographs or any other uniquely identifying codes or characteristics\nBe very strict and conservative. Any instance of an identifier present or insufficiently masked means the transcript is not HIPAA compliant. This includes partial identifiers or ambiguous cases where there is reasonable risk of re-identification.\nConsider context carefully; if a term can reasonably be interpreted as PHI, flag it.\nFor “position” in your report, prefer specifying the character start and end indices in the text. If that is not feasible, provide a clear descriptive location such as paragraph or line number.\nRespond only in the following JSON format (no additional commentary):\n{\n  \"hipaa_compliant\": <true|false>,\n  \"fail_identifiers\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"<PHI identifier type>\",\n      \"text\": \"<offending text>\",\n      \"position\": \"<start and end index or descriptive location>\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"comments\": \"<short summary and advice>\"\n}\nExample:\nIf the transcript contains \"John Doe\" or \"123 Main St\", flag them under \"type\" as \"name\" and \"address\" respectively, with the exact offending text and its location in the transcript.\n\nReview the provided transcript thoroughly and return only the strict JSON output.\n",
