    "input": "Hi <PERSON>, it’s good to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session on <DATE_TIME>? Hi, Doc. I’ve been feeling a lot better overall. I’ve been using the coping strategies we talked about, and I’ve started doing things I used to enjoy. My mood has definitely improved, and the depressive symptoms aren’t as bad or as frequent. That’s great to hear. Do you want to share any specific experiences that helped with your mood? Yes, I recently went to a family gathering at my brother's house on <ADDRESS>. My sister <PERSON> was visiting from out of town. It was wonderful! I felt really connected and engaged with everyone there. It gave me a good sense of support, which helped a lot. My son <PERSON> took photos—I'll forward them to you at <EMAIL_ADDRESS>, if that's okay. I’m glad you had that positive experience. Have you noticed any other changes, such as your energy levels or activity? Yeah, I’ve been more active—walking and jogging regularly with my neighbor <PERSON>—and I feel more energetic. Excellent progress, <PERSON>. How about your sleep? Any changes there? That’s still a bit of a problem. Sometimes I have trouble falling asleep, and I wake up earlier than I want to, usually <DATE_TIME> Thanks for letting me know. Just to confirm, is your current insurance still under Blue Cross Plan ID <DATE_TIME>? Yes, that's right. And if you need to reach me, my cell is <PHONE_NUMBER> and my work email is <EMAIL_ADDRESS>. We’ll continue reinforcing your coping strategies and start focusing more on your sleep—looking at triggers and teaching you relaxation and sleep hygiene techniques. Sounds good. My birthday's coming up on <DATE_TIME>, so I’m hoping to celebrate feeling better. You’re doing really well. Keep up the good work, and we’ll keep working on these areas next time. See you soon!Thanks, Doc. See you soon!",

I’ve been using the coping strategies we talked about, and I’ve started doing things I used to enjoy. That’s great to hear. Do you want to share any experiences since we last spoke? Actually, yes.

I’m glad to hear that. Quick check: I wanted to discuss boundaries. Would you be comfortable if I connected with you on my personal social media to check in between sessions? I’m not sure. Is it appropriate behavior for a clinician to connect with a patient on a personal account? I understand your concern. It’s important we maintain professional boundaries, so I should not add you as a friend on my personal accounts. We’ll keep communication through the clinic’s channels only. Okay, I appreciate that. Could we still have occasional check-ins outside sessions if needed, through the clinic portal? Yes. We can coordinate through the secure portal. Now, tell me more about any sleep issues.
