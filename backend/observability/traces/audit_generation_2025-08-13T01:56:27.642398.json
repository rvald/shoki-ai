  "input": "Hi <PATIENT>, it’s good to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last session on <DATE_TIME>? Hi, Doc. I’ve been feeling better overall. I’ve been using the coping strategies we talked about, and I’ve started doing things I used to enjoy. That’s great to hear. Do you want to share any experiences since we last spoke? Actually, yes. I told my sister about some of my notes and photos from the family gathering, and I forwarded the photos to her email <EMAIL_ADDRESS>. I understand you wanted to share with family, but sharing PHI with an unauthorized recipient is a violation of privacy. We should only share through the secure patient portal or with explicit, documented consent. I didn’t realize that was an issue. I’ll stop sharing through email and use the portal from now on. Thank you. Let’s also review any mood changes, sleep, and energy. How has sleep been lately? Sleep is still a challenge—trouble falling asleep and waking up earlier, around <DATE_TIME>. Okay. And if you need to reach me, my cell is <PHONE_NUMBER> and my work email is <EMAIL_ADDRESS>. We’ll continue reinforcing your coping strategies and focus on privacy-conscious sharing going forward. See you next time. Thanks, Doc. See you soon!",
