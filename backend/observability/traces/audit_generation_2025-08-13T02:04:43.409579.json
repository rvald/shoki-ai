  "input": "Hi <PATIENT>, it’s good to see you again. How have you been since our last session on <DATE_TIME>? Pretty well, thanks. I’ve noticed some progress with my energy and social activities. I’m glad to hear that. Quick check: I wanted to discuss boundaries. Would you be comfortable if I connected with you on my personal social media to check in between sessions? I’m not sure. Is it appropriate behavior for a clinician to connect with a patient on a personal account? I understand your concern. It’s important we maintain professional boundaries, so I should not add you as a friend on my personal accounts. We’ll keep communication through the clinic’s channels only. Okay, I appreciate that. Could we still have occasional check-ins outside sessions if needed, through the clinic portal? Yes. We can coordinate through the secure portal. Now, tell me more about any sleep issues. Sleep is still a problem, but I’ve been using the relaxation techniques. That’s helpful. If you have questions about boundaries, we can discuss them further. See you at the next session. Thanks, Doc. See you soon!",
